rtl8812au for Raspbery Pi
========================

```
make
sudo make install
```

Linux kernel driver for rtl8812au/rtl8821au/rtl8811au USB WiFi chipsets.

Experimental build of driver-5.1.5 branch from uminokoe/rtl8812AU, with some
patches from diederikdehaas/rtl8812AU to build it on ArchLinuxARM.

Note that I'm not supporting or developing this driver here, just collected a
bunch of ad-hoc patches from different sources for my own purposes.

Please do not ask me to add or merge additional featues or fix something here -
I'm not a kernel developer and don't even have hardware to test this locally.

Based on the include/rtw_version.h, the version is 5.1.5.

Supported usb dongles is listed in os_dep/linux/usb_intf.c.

Performance
-----------

Should very heavily depend on card/dongle used, but with ALFA Network AWUS036AC
USB dongles plugged into RPi3/ODROID-C2 that I've tested using WiFi
Infrastructure mode (AP + STA) over VHT (802.11ac) with 80MHz channels (in 5GHz
band) and TX-STBC-2BY1/RX-STBC-1 MIMO parameters, throughput limit seem to be
about 220mbps or ~26 MiB/s (half-duplex).

I.e. something that looks like this::

Again, these results are for one specific dongle, running in a specific
environment, so does not mean that other devices supported by this driver will
have same limitations, and are here just to show that driver itself can at least
support that much throughput (easily - extra cpu load is negligible).

Relevant hostapd.conf options used for this specific dongle and test::

  hw_mode=a
  ieee80211n=1
  require_ht=1
  ieee80211ac=1
  require_vht=1

  channel=149
  vht_oper_chwidth=1
  vht_oper_centr_freq_seg0_idx=155
  ht_capab=[HT40+][SHORT-GI-40]
  vht_capab=[SHORT-GI-80][TX-STBC-2BY1][MAX-MPDU-11454][MAX-A-MPDU-LEN-EXP7][RX-STBC-1]

Same as for test results, these aren't necessarily supported by all dongles, and
other dongles might allow e.g. 160MHz or 80+80 channel widths (different
vht_oper_chwidth values), 2x2 or 4x4 STBC, beamforming, and such, which driver
seem to reject for AWUS036AC that was used here, but has the code for.
